# Pi_model
This code implements pi_model as per the paper Realistic Evaluation of Deep Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms link="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09170"
the model for now works on MNIST dataset , this model has framework taken from https://github.com/ferretj/temporal-ensembling 
<br /> 
Read "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02242" for better understanding  

# Goals to be achieved 
Improve the accuracy of the model by adding gaussian noise , transforms <br /> 
Run the code on CIFAR10 dataset and SVHN dataset <br /> 
Get the norm of the gradient and figure out a better algorithm <br />
